    <ul>
        <li>Coffee</li>
         <p>Coffee is a beverage brewed from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter,
             and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to
              its caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the world market for hot drinks.[2]
            The seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee
             beans. The beans are roasted and then ground into fine particles typically steeped in
              hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. It is
             usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common</p>
        <li>Tea</li>
        <p>Tea, beverage produced by steeping in freshly boiled water the young leaves and leaf buds
             of the tea plant, Camellia sinensis. Two principal varieties are used, the small-leaved
             China plant (C. sinensis variety sinensis) and the large-leaved Assam plant (C. sinensis 
             variety assamica). Hybrids of these two varieties are also grown. The leaves may be fermented 
             or left unfermented.

        <li>Milk</li>
        <p>Milk is a white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition
             for young mammals (including breastfed human infants) before they are able to digest solid food.[1] Immune
              factors and immune-modulating components in milk contribute to milk immunity. Early-lactation milk, which 
              is called colostrum, contains antibodies that strengthen the immune system and thus reduce the risk of many
               diseases. Milk contains many nutrients, including protein and lactose.
            As an agricultural product, dairy milk is collected from farm animals. In 2011, dairy farms produced around 730 
            million tonnes (800 million short tons) of milk[3] from 260 million dairy cows.[4] India</p>
